# Humantime
"Close enough" time that makes sense when reading it.

Port of [date-fns](https://date-fns.org).[formatDistance](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/main/src/formatDistance/index.ts)

There are two methods `time_between` and `time_since`. 

`time_between` takes two datetime objects and returns the time elapsed.

`time_since` takes a single datetime object and calculates the difference between that and now.

## Usage

```python
from datetime import datetime

from src import humantime

jan_1st = datetime(year=2015, month=1, day=1)
seconds_later = datetime(year=2015, month=1, day=1, second=15)

print(humantime.time_between(jan_1st, seconds_later))
# "less than a minute"
```
